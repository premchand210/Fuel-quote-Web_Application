# SD-spring-2020
This repository contains code and details about our software design spring 2020 project.
The login page is index.php
Registration page is signupEditing.php
If the registration is successful, it directs us to thankyou.php page.
Once you pass the login page, you will be directed to overview.php and from there, you can find a navigation bar which is very helpful in accessing client profile and fuel quote and client history pages.
Client profile page is indexprofileEditing.php
Fuel quote page is fuelquoteEditing.php
client history page is fuelquotehistory.php
All these pages are associaated with three tables namely users_reg for holding user credentials; client_profile to store client details; fuel_quote to save the history of client.
Style sheets for every page including navigation bar are uploaded to this repository.
